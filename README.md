ðŸ‘‹ Hello,

Yes, this profile is sparse, well, um, completely empty.

I'll get around to updating this and putting some useful details at some point, but for now, if you have questions, you know how to reach me.

I have worked in the education space for well over 20 years ranging from laboratory/research programmer to IT helpdesk to system/DB admin back to programmer to a technical architect back to programmer and finally as an IT Manager.

My goal is to show how technology (specifically software, web and internet connected devices) really, truly can help people focus on what matters most.  The data, the content, the reports and statistics are what empower people and organizations to move forward.  Technology should be a supporting factor, not a hindrance.

I also don't believe in restrictions on people.  Why not allow a job, event, activity, whatever it may be to happen 24/7 and from anywhere in the world that has a network connection?

If you have an interesting project, especially in the education space, don't hesitate to reach out to me.
